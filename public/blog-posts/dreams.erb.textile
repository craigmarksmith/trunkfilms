h1. Dreams

Have you ever seen something or seen someone do something you have always wanted to do or thought, hey that's cool I wonder how I can do that!?

I for one have, but how easy is it to just go and do it? Often I find an excuse, not enough time, money, skill or something to that effect. It's shrugged off.

How often do we follow through with our dreams? And if you truly ask yourself, when you were a kid did you want to be doing what you are doing right now when you grew up? If yes I applaud you. For the majority of us however I am guessing that we give up on or forget our dreams for one reason or another.

What would happen if you gave it bash, did something you always wanted to do? Would it really be that impossibly difficult to achieve? It's good to dream but it's better to do.

What did you want to be when you grew up?
